I am currently working as DFIR analyst and IR in CERT La Poste.

During my free time, I improve my personal skills praticing Root-Me, Hack The Box and Try hack Me challenges.  
I practice lots of ctf alone, with some friends or with the team [HackInProvence](https://www.hackinprovence.fr/).

Special thanks to hugo. It permits me to develop this website with love <3.
