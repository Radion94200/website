# HACKATHON DESIGN4GREEN

With my engineerinf school I participate to the [Design4Green](https://design4green.org/) hackathon.
This hackaton is a 48-hour non-stop digital eco-design challenge. It's open to students and professionals with computer science knowledge.
Let's start this new challenge at 9 today!
