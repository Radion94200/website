# EUROPEAN CYBER WEEK

The [European Cyber Week](https://www.european-cyber-week.eu/) is a cybersecurity convention which takes place in Rennes.
During this event a CTF is organized for students only.
The top 50 in the ranking qualifies for the final phase.

After two weeks of work, I am proud to announce that I am qualified for the ECW finals.
With the context, currently, we don't know if the final will be maintained. Howerver, this give me the opportunity to thanks all the organizer of the CTF.

Let's go and we'll see for the future.
