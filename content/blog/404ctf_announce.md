# 404CTF

I'm proud to announce the new version of the 404CTF.
This is one of the best CTF I done.

This year is the third edition of this CTF created in 2022. The CTF theme of this year is still kept secret.
The previous themes of the ctf were:

- Honoring the great figures of French literature,
- The celebration of the double anniversary of the BCRA and the DGSE.

Like you can see it's a french CTF and the duration is 3 weeks.

The starting date is `20/04/2024 - 20h00`.

Thanks for reading!
