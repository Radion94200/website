Currenlty, I work as DFIR analyst and IR in CERT La Poste.

During my free time, I improve my personal skills praticing Root-Me and Hack The Box challenges.
I do lots of ctf alone or with some friends and with the team [HackInProvence](https://www.hackinprovence.fr/).

Special thanks to hugo. It permits me to develop this website with love.
